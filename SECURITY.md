# Security Policy

## Overview

Ensuring the security and integrity of our project is an absolute top priority for us. This Security Policy provides a comprehensive set of guidelines detailing the supported versions of our project and the process for reporting any vulnerabilities that are discovered. We aim to ensure that our users, developers, and other stakeholders can work in a safe and secure environment while maintaining a transparent and collaborative process for addressing security issues. The maintenance of a secure system is fundamental to our mission of delivering reliable software that users can trust.

Our approach to security is proactive and built on a foundation of best practices that are continuously updated in response to emerging threats. Our team is dedicated to constant monitoring, timely updates, and responsive action in case of reported vulnerabilities. The active involvement of our user community in identifying and reporting potential security issues plays a critical role in safeguarding the overall integrity of our project. Your contributions are highly valued and vital to our continued success.

## Supported Versions

This section provides detailed information regarding the versions of our project that are actively maintained with comprehensive security updates. Our commitment is to provide users with the most current security patches, optimizations, and enhancements to ensure the resilience and robustness of our system. We strive to offer timely updates to all supported versions, thereby ensuring maximum security for our users and their data. Please refer to the table below for specific details on the versions that are currently supported:

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 5.1.x   | :white_check_mark: |
| 5.0.x   | :x:                |
| 4.0.x   | :white_check_mark: |
| < 4.0   | :x:                |

We strongly recommend that users always upgrade to the latest supported version of the software to leverage the full spectrum of security enhancements, performance improvements, and mitigations provided. Regular updates are a critical part of maintaining a secure environment, and upgrading ensures you are always protected against known vulnerabilities and emerging threats that could potentially compromise your system. Staying up to date also allows you to benefit from the latest features and optimizations that improve both performance and usability.

The importance of keeping your software up to date cannot be overstated. Software vulnerabilities are continually being discovered, and failing to update can leave your system exposed to exploitation. Our team works tirelessly to identify and mitigate these vulnerabilities, and the best way for users to protect themselves is by ensuring they are running the most current supported version of the software. By upgrading, you not only enhance your own security posture but also contribute to the overall strength of our community by minimizing the attack surface available to malicious actors.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability, we urge you to communicate it to us immediately so that we can take appropriate action to safeguard our users and systems. Ensuring the security and integrity of our project is a collaborative effort, and we highly value the vigilance and contributions of the community in this endeavor. Your efforts in reporting vulnerabilities help us ensure that our software remains secure and reliable for all users.

To report a vulnerability, please send an email to [security@ourproject.com](mailto:security@ourproject.com). We are committed to acknowledging your report within 48 hours of receipt. Throughout the evaluation and remediation process, we will maintain transparent communication regarding the status of your report, including any investigatory steps we are taking. We understand the importance of providing timely feedback, and we strive to keep you informed as we work towards a resolution.

Should the reported vulnerability be validated, our team will prioritize the development of an appropriate corrective measure. We will ensure that you are notified when a patch is issued or when any other relevant updates become available. Our response process is designed to be thorough and efficient, focusing on addressing vulnerabilities in a way that minimizes risk while providing clear and timely communication to the reporter.

Our objective is to address all security vulnerabilities in a manner that is both judicious and responsible. We deeply appreciate your patience and cooperation as we work to uphold the security of our project. Security vulnerabilities can be complex, and developing an appropriate fix requires careful analysis and testing to ensure that the solution is effective and does not introduce new issues. Your understanding during this process is invaluable, and we are committed to resolving each vulnerability with the utmost care and diligence.

The contributions of security researchers, developers, and the broader community are indispensable in our efforts to cultivate a secure and resilient ecosystem for all stakeholders. By working together, we can ensure that our project remains robust against both current and future threats. We are always looking for ways to improve our security processes, and your feedback and involvement are key components of that continuous improvement.

We are profoundly grateful for your dedication to enhancing the security of our project. Your vigilance and proactive approach to identifying vulnerabilities help us maintain the integrity and trustworthiness of our software. By supporting our mission to deliver a reliable, secure, and resilient product, you are contributing to a community that values safety, transparency, and collaboration above all else. Together, we can create a more secure digital environment for everyone who relies on our project.
